## Objective

It's necessary to add swagger for all required microservices to have each endpoint documented. But have multiple 
swaggers is not intuitive, so it's also necessary to unify them. This could be done by the API Gateway itself.

## Solution

### Add swagger for each microservice

### Unify Swagger-UI from all microservices into API Gateway
